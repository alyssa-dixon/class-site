            <p>Alt-Text description poster to practice accessible design.</p>

            <p>This poster was to preactice writing out alt-text descriptions. By finding a photo of our chossing, we were prompted to write out the alt-text, and redesign that text into a poster without using the original image. I used an image of a green fluffy chair, with the description "a short fluffy chair with patches of green fur covering the entire seat sits in the center of the room. The chair resembles fuzzy broccoli and has four skinny wood stain brushed legs that support at a slight angle." This description is displayed in an evenly spaced paragraph in a pixelated yellow text, centered on the poster. A 3D outline of the chair sits behind the text with a green fur texture in the very back. A shadow sits under the chair to reflect dimension.</p>
