            <h1>Call for Disabled Artists Poster</h1>
            <p>Poster design for the VCU Anderson call for disabled artists event.</p>

            <p>This poster design was made in mind for disabled artists, while keeping the requested bubblegum sunset color palette in mind. "Call for Disabled Artists" reads at the top in large lettering with the submission period dates following underneath. An illustrated two headed calf lays at the bottom of the poster, with white clouds and yellow sparkles above its head. A QR code is included in the bottom right for access to more information for the artist call.</p>
