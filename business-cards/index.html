                <h1>Business Cards</h1>
                <p>These business cards I designed personally, and trimmed myself. I made sure to include contact information for my graphic design and print practices. My cards are typically distributed at art markets in Richmond when I get the chance to table at an event. I also had a chance to laser engrave this design after completing orientation for the Epilog Zing 24 laser cutter.
