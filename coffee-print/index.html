            <h1>Handmade Screenprint</h1>
            <p>Screenprint using a hand drawn stencil on duralar film. Printed in process cyan and magenta ink on paper.</p>

            <p>This print was to practice creating hand drawn stencils and learning the basics of setting up a screen for screenprinting. We drew two layers of stencil on film using black markers, burning them into our screen, and printing them on paper with two process colors of our choosing. My print consists of cyan and fluorescent pink, where the overlapping colors create a rich purple. "Stay Caffeinated reads in all caps in the bottom center with a steaming cup of coffee sitting at an angle in the center of the print.</p>
