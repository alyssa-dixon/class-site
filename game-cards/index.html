            <h1>Game Translation</h1>
            <p>Card game meant for gentle discussion and practice with small talk related topics. A lime green box contains a deck of brown cards. One card laying on the table reads, "describe your worst testing experience."</p>

            <p>This card game was made to practice the act of translation. By creating a game that had some kind of chance and change with discussion, we can create a space of moving text from one place to another. The game I created begins with a group of at least four pull a card from the deck. From there, a question is read outloud that warrants further discussion. Each player rolls a dice, and the number they get is how many words they can use to describe their answer in written form. Even as each player writes down their response, gentle conversation of each experience is encouraged.</p>
