            <h1>Screenprint Totes</h1>
            <p>Screenprinted totes in four designs. Print shows a heart in multiple colors that reads "get out of your head." This tote print was a chance for me to practice fabric screenprinting on my own time. After completing my first screenprint course, I decided to try printing on totes with my own 110 mesh screen using a digital stencil I printed and exposed. I made four different color designs in black, red, blue, and a fourth design that reads "this tote contains cool stuff" with a smiley face below the text.</p>
