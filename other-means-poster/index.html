            <h1>Other Means Lecture Poster</h1>
            <p>Poster design for VCU's graphic design department Other Means guest lecture event.</p>

            <p>This poster design is inspired by the studio <i>Other Means</i> and their recent design for GOD at p-r-i-m-e-t-i-m-e event. Using bold complimentary colors, my aim was to create a subject that plays into the text details, like the potato image in the GOD at p-r-i-m-e-t-i-m-e post. By angling the imagery of the egg toast figure, I was able to bring the viewer back to the information at the bottom for the lecture happening through VCU on October 31.</p>
