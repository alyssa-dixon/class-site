    <p>My current education is at Virginia Commonwealth University. My major is in graphic design, and my minor in printmaking. I'm originally from Carroll County, Maryland and I'm 22 years old. I’m a 5’7” white female with pin straight shoulder length hazelnut colored hair. I have a longer, straight nose with a mole on the right side of my cheek. I have pierced ears and small tattoos running up both arms and will typically be wearing muted earth toned clothes. While I reside in Richmond to complete my BFA, I completed a Spring 2023 internship as a junior designer with Jennifer Elsner, an art director and designer for <i><b>The Moment</b></i>, a quarterly issue for <i><b>Boketto Wellness</b></i>. I recently completed a Summer 2023 internship at <i><b>Studio Two Three</b></i> in Richmond,VA. I'm currently an intern at <i><b>1708 Gallery</b></i> and a studio monitor at the <i><b>Visual Arts Center</b></i>, both located in Richmond.</p>
