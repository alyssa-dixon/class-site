            <h1>Posters Only Poster</h1>
            <p>Poster design marking the end of the semester for the Posters Only class. Names of all the students are listed along with the title "Posters Only" in a serif font. This poster became a collab piece, where we rescnned the original Posters Only class syllabus onto our designs and hung up for display in the design building to mark the end of our semester. I used sharpie markers on paper and scanned in my design to print again.</p>
