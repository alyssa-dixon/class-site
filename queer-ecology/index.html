            <h1>Queer Ecology Poster</h1>
            <p>Poster design for VCU's graphic design department Jen Ansley guest lecture event.</p>

            <p>This poster design is for Jen Ansley's 'Queer Ecology & Design,' which is hosted by Index Space in Winter 2023. The lecture focuses on how and why queer ecological relationships reimagine and shape our paths as designers. I used cut out images of dandelions in the poster, as Jen describes weeds as outliers of a landscape and their influence on adaption and environmental disruption. Bright yellow and greens are used in the poster for reflection of growth and sunlight, while the background texture resembles tree bark.</p>
