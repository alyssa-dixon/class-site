            <h1>Relief Print</h1>
            <p>Relief print using a hand carved design from a linolium block. A small swiss army knife sits in the center with red ink in the background.</p>

            <p>This print was a personal project to play with colored ink in a single subject. I carved this image of a swiss army knife with a linolium block, practicing relief printing as a chance to step away from digital media amongst my school semester.</p>
