            <h1>Risopraph Poster</h1>
            <p>Risograph test print for a poster design class. Our goal was to print with at least four different layers of color after completion of Risograph Training Orientation. As we became familiar with switiching out different colored drums and switching to new masters, we completed a poster print of our own design.</p>
