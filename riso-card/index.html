            <h1>Risograph Birthday Card</h1>
            <p>This card was handrawn and scanned into a risograph printer using two colors. Each card contained an envelope and plastic sleeve for protection. Curated and produced at Studio Two Three in Richmond, VA.</p>

            <p>Three illustartions were drawn out on paper for this piece; the text, "May your birthday be as awesome as this cake" in all caps, the icing layer shown in blue, and the piping and strawberries shown in fluorescent pink. By scanning these drawings onto a risograph printer, I created 30+ cards in these two-color print.</p>
