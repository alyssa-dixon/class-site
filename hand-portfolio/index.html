            <h1>Print Practice & Theory Collection</h1>
            <p>Handmade portfolio contains 8 screenprints of hand made type excerpts with hand sketches of unfolding fist. Screenprints are bookended with carved relief print that show three hand forms in black ink.</p>

            <p>This was the final project of our Print Practice & Theory class. Our goal was to create this final piece as a wrap up of our research in two different types of printmaking processes. I chose relief printing as well as screenprinting for this piece, where I dove into a writing practice to describe handmade processes and their significance in my practice of design and print. I made the portfolio to contain all the prints and to be picked up during exhibition.</p>
