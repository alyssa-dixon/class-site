            <h1>Alexis Mark Lecture Poster</h1>
            <p>Poster design for VCU's graphic design department Alexis Mark guest lecture event.</p>

            <p>This poster design is for the studio <i>Alexis Mark</i>, the shared pseudonym of Marie Grønkær, Kristoffer Li & Martin Bek, and an office for graphic design, creative direction and communication strategies located in Copenhagen. In their publications and exhibitions, a lot of clashing bright colors in open discussion spaces tend to stand out the most, so I wanted to reflect that environment in this piece. A pool water image is used to fill the entire poster, with the title "Alexis Mark Studio" floats in a cascading formation with a hyphen at the word studio. The title text is a light blue color outlined with a bold process red in reflection to blood in a pool. </p>
